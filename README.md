# PROJECT-ON-TELE-MARKETING-CAMPAIGNS-OF-EUROPEAN-BANKING-INSTITUTIONS
The data is about telemarketing campaigns of a European banking institution.  The European bank wants to predict which clients will secure a term deposit based on a set of information on client and purchase of term deposit. The marketing is usually based on phone calls. Often, a client need to be persuaded multiple times in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be or not subscribed. Predictive modelling approach will help the bank to manage their telemarketing campaign efficiently.  So basically, here we will start our project with having a brief outline of the project i.e. by adopting certain methodology to proceed further. Here we will use CTQR consulting framework and DER analytics framework. From which we will decide which modelling technique to be applied and the technology to be used is also decided. After deciding these we will proceed with the project and the first part here is we will check for the missing values and the outliers. And after that imputation of done. And then we will scale the data so that the model developed won’t be biased. We will use R to build the model , the models include Logistic Regression , Decision Tree , SVM , Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and KNN.
